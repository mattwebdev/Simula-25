# Simula 2025: The Future of Simulation-First Programming

## Purpose-Built for AI Pipelines, Simulation Workloads, and Scalable Systems

In a world of general-purpose programming languages, Simula 2025 stands apart by being purpose-built for simulation while maintaining the power and flexibility needed for modern software development. It's not just another OOP language—it's a reimagining of the original simulation language that started it all, now evolved to meet the demands of modern AI and distributed systems.

> **Simula 2025 proudly continues the legacy of Kristen Nygaard and Ole-Johan Dahl, whose pioneering work on the original Simula language laid the foundation for object-oriented programming and simulation modeling.**

## Real-World Applications

### 1. System Simulation
```simula
// Modeling a manufacturing system
class ProductionLine {
    Queue<Part> inputQueue;
    Machine[] machines;
    
    void simulate() {
        while (true) {
            Part part = inputQueue.dequeue();
            for (Machine machine : machines) {
                machine.process(part);
                hold(processingTime());
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### 2. Network Simulation
```simula
// Modeling network traffic
class NetworkNode {
    Channel<Packet>[] connections;
    
    void handleTraffic() {
        while (true) {
            Packet packet = receive();
            if (packet.needsRouting()) {
                route(packet);
            }
            hold(transmissionTime());
        }
    }
}
```

### 3. Business Process Modeling
```simula
// Modeling a business workflow
class Workflow {
    Resource[] resources;
    Process[] steps;
    
    void execute() {
        for (Process step : steps) {
            Resource resource = allocateResource();
            step.execute(resource);
            releaseResource(resource);
        }
    }
}
```

### 4. AI Platform Development
```simula
// Modeling an AI training pipeline
class AITrainingSystem {
    Queue<DataBatch> dataQueue;
    Resource<GPU> gpu;
    Process[] workers;
    
    void train() {
        while (true) {
            DataBatch batch = dataQueue.dequeue();
            gpu.acquire();
            trainModel(batch);
            gpu.release();
            hold(evaluationTime());
        }
    }
}

// Distributed AI inference
class InferenceCluster {
    Channel<Request>[] nodes;
    
    void handleRequests() {
        while (true) {
            Request request = receive();
            if (request.needsRouting()) {
                routeToOptimalNode(request);
