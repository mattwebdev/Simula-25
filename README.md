# Simula 25

A modern domain-specific language designed for AI and AI model development, leveraging the power of discrete event simulation to create, test, and deploy intelligent systems.

## Historical Context

Simula 25 builds upon the rich legacy of simulation programming languages, tracing its roots back to Simula 67, created by Ole-Johan Dahl and Kristen Nygaard at the Norwegian Computing Center in the 1960s. Their groundbreaking work not only pioneered simulation programming but also laid the foundation for object-oriented programming as we know it today.

### The Birth of Simula

The journey began in 1961 when Nygaard started working on simulation languages at the Norwegian Defense Research Establishment. By 1962, he had joined forces with Dahl, and together they created Simula I, the first language specifically designed for simulation. Their work culminated in Simula 67, which introduced revolutionary concepts that would shape computing for decades to come.

As Nygaard later reflected:
> "We were not trying to invent a new programming paradigm. We were trying to solve a problem: how to describe complex systems in a way that was natural to the problem domain."

Dahl added:
> "The key insight was that simulation models should be described in terms of the system being simulated, not in terms of the computer."

### Key Historical Milestones

- **1961**: Nygaard begins work on simulation languages
- **1962**: Dahl joins the project, leading to Simula I
- **1967**: Simula 67 is released, introducing classes and objects
- **1970**: First international Simula User's Group meeting
- **1973**: Simula 67 becomes an international standard
- **2001**: Dahl and Nygaard receive the ACM A.M. Turing Award
- **2002**: The term "object-oriented programming" is officially recognized in computing literature

### Influence on Programming Languages

Simula's influence extended far beyond simulation, inspiring numerous programming languages:

- **Smalltalk**: Alan Kay's vision of object-oriented programming was directly inspired by Simula
- **C++**: Bjarne Stroustrup based C++'s class system on Simula's concepts
- **Java**: Inherited many object-oriented concepts from Simula through C++
- **Python**: Adopted Simula's approach to object-oriented design
- **Ruby**: Matsumoto explicitly cited Simula as an influence

### Simulation Language Evolution

Following Simula, several specialized simulation languages emerged:

- **GPSS** (1961): General Purpose Simulation System
- **SIMSCRIPT** (1963): First simulation language with English-like syntax
- **SIMULA** (1967): First object-oriented simulation language
- **SLAM** (1979): Simulation Language for Alternative Modeling
- **Arena** (1993): Modern discrete event simulation software
- **AnyLogic** (2000): Multi-method simulation platform

Dahl and Nygaard's vision was to create a language that could naturally express simulation models, leading to the development of concepts like classes, objects, and inheritance. Their work influenced generations of programming languages and continues to shape how we think about software development.

Simula 25 honors this legacy by modernizing these concepts while maintaining the core principles that made Simula revolutionary:
- Process-oriented simulation
- Object-oriented design
- Discrete event modeling
- Clear separation of model and simulation logic

## Overview

Simula 25 reimagines the classic simulation language as a modern domain-specific language (DSL) for AI development. By combining Simula's powerful simulation capabilities with contemporary language features, it provides a natural and intuitive way to model, simulate, and deploy AI systems. The language's process-oriented nature and discrete event simulation capabilities make it particularly well-suited for:

- Developing and testing AI models
- Simulating complex AI systems and their interactions
- Modeling real-world scenarios for AI training
- Creating digital twins of AI-powered systems
- Prototyping and validating AI architectures
